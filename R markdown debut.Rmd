## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)


```

This is where I interpret stuff.

```{r}
 # scatterplot with mpg dataset

mpg %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Engine Displacement (L)",
       y = "Highway MPG",
       title = "Highway MPG vs Engine Displacement",
       color = "Drive Type") +
  theme_minimal()
```

Let's clean it!

```{r}
mpg_clean <- mpg %>%
  filter(cty > 20)
```


```{r}
view(mpg_clean)
unique(mpg$cty)
length(unique(mpg$cty))
```

```{r}
mpg %>%
  count(manufacturer) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  rename("Number of Vehicles" = n)

```

```{r}

  mpg_clean <- mpg_clean %>%
  mutate(colors = case_when(model == "camry")
        
```
